# Parts Carousel Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a horizontal carousel/slider for parts selection in the Complete Service modal. When technicians add multiple parts, they can navigate between them using Previous/Next buttons, with smooth slide animations.

## Features

### 1. **Carousel Navigation**
- Previous/Next buttons to navigate between part entries
- Shows current position: "Part 1 of 3"
- Buttons are disabled at start/end of carousel
- Smooth CSS transitions when sliding

### 2. **Visual Indicators**
- **Current Index**: Displays which part entry is currently visible
- **Total Count**: Shows total number of part entries
- **Selected Counter**: Badge showing "X selected" based on filled parts

### 3. **Add Part Behavior**
- Click "Add Another Part/Consumable"
- New blank part entry slides in from the right
- Automatically navigates to the new entry
- Each entry has independent brand/part selection

### 4. **Remove Part Behavior**
- Delete button on each part entry
- Cannot delete the last remaining entry
- Automatically adjusts carousel position after deletion
- Smooth transition to previous part if current is deleted

## HTML Structure

```html
<!-- Carousel Header with Navigation -->
<div class="flex items-center justify-between mb-4">
    <div class="flex items-center gap-3">
        <span>Part <span id="currentPartIndex">1</span> of <span id="totalParts">1</span></span>
        <div class="badge">
            <span id="totalPartsSelected">0 selected</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Navigation Buttons -->
    <div class="flex items-center gap-2">
        <button id="prevPartBtn">←</button>
        <button id="nextPartBtn">→</button>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Carousel Wrapper -->
<div class="overflow-hidden rounded-2xl">
    <!-- Slides Container -->
    <div id="partsContainer" class="flex transition-transform duration-500">
        <!-- Part Entry 1 (min-w-full) -->
        <div class="part-entry min-w-full">...</div>
        <!-- Part Entry 2 (min-w-full) -->
        <div class="part-entry min-w-full">...</div>
        <!-- Part Entry 3 (min-w-full) -->
        <div class="part-entry min-w-full">...</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## CSS Classes

### Key Classes Added:
- `min-w-full` - Makes each part entry take full width of container
- `flex` - Makes container display children horizontally
- `overflow-hidden` - Hides slides outside viewport
- `transition-transform duration-500` - Smooth slide animation

## JavaScript Functions

### State Variables
```javascript
let currentPartSlide = 0;        // Current visible slide index
let totalPartSlides = 1;         // Total number of slides
```

### Core Functions

#### 1. `updateCarousel()`
- Calculates transform translateX value
- Updates container position
- Updates navigation info and buttons
- **Transform Formula**: `translateX(-(currentPartSlide * 100)%)`

#### 2. `updateCarouselInfo()`
- Updates "Part X of Y" display
- Counts selected parts (with values)
- Updates "X selected" badge

#### 3. `updateCarouselButtons()`
- Enables/disables Previous button (disabled at index 0)
- Enables/disables Next button (disabled at last index)

#### 4. `navigateToPreviousPart()`
- Decrements currentPartSlide
- Calls updateCarousel()
- Slides left

#### 5. `navigateToNextPart()`
- Increments currentPartSlide  
- Calls updateCarousel()
- Slides right

#### 6. `setupCarouselNavigation()`
- Attaches click handlers to Prev/Next buttons
- Initializes carousel state
- Called when modal opens

### Modified Functions

#### `addPartEntry()`
**Changes**:
- Added `min-w-full` class to new entries
- Updates totalPartSlides count
- Sets currentPartSlide to new entry index
- Calls updateCarousel() to slide to new entry

#### `updatePartRemoveHandlers()`
**Changes**:
- Tracks deleted entry index
- Adjusts currentPartSlide if needed
- Prevents going out of bounds
- Calls updateCarousel() after deletion

#### `updatePartNumbers()`
**Changes**:
- Now also calls `updateCarouselInfo()`
- Updates selected count when parts change

#### `closeJobCompletionModal()`
**Changes**:
- Resets carousel state (currentPartSlide = 0)
- Resets transform to starting position

## User Flow

### Adding Parts:
```
1. Modal opens → Shows Part 1 of 1
2. Fill Part 1 (Brand: Epson, Part: Toner)
3. Click "Add Another Part/Consumable"
4. → Slides to Part 2 of 2 (new blank form)
5. Fill Part 2 (Brand: HP, Part: Ink)
6. Click "Add Another Part/Consumable"  
7. → Slides to Part 3 of 3 (new blank form)
```

### Navigating:
```
Current: Part 3 of 3
- Click Previous → Slides to Part 2 of 3
- Click Previous → Slides to Part 1 of 3
- Previous button becomes disabled (at start)
- Click Next → Slides to Part 2 of 3
- Click Next → Slides to Part 3 of 3
- Next button becomes disabled (at end)
```

### Removing:
```
At Part 2 of 3:
- Click delete on Part 2
- → Slides to Part 1 (previous part)
- Now shows Part 1 of 2
```

## Animation Details

### Slide Transition:
- **Duration**: 500ms
- **Easing**: ease-in-out
- **Property**: transform (translateX)
- **Hardware Accelerated**: Yes (uses transform)

### Example Transforms:
- Part 1: `translateX(0%)`
- Part 2: `translateX(-100%)`
- Part 3: `translateX(-200%)`
- Part 4: `translateX(-300%)`

## Benefits

1. **Space Efficient**: Only shows one part entry at a time
2. **Clean UI**: Doesn't clutter screen with multiple forms
3. **Clear Navigation**: Users know exactly where they are
4. **Smooth UX**: Professional slide animations
5. **Independent Entries**: Each part entry works independently
6. **Visual Feedback**: Counter shows selected parts vs total

## Technical Notes

### Why `min-w-full`?
- Ensures each slide takes exactly 100% of container width
- Prevents slides from shrinking when flex container calculates space
- Critical for carousel math to work correctly

### Why `overflow-hidden`?
- Hides slides that are off-screen
- Creates the "window" effect
- Prevents horizontal scrollbar

### Why CSS Transform?
- Hardware accelerated (smooth 60fps animation)
- Better performance than animating left/right
- No layout recalculation needed

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Touch-friendly buttons
- ✅ Smooth on low-end devices (CSS transform)

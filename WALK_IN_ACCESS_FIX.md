# Walk-In Service Request Access Fix - Complete

## Problem
Technicians were unable to start or perform actions on walk-in service requests, receiving the error:
```
Error: You do not have access to this service request
```

## Root Cause
The backend access control checks were using `INNER JOIN` on `technician_assignments` table, which requires matching `institution_id`. Since walk-in requests have `institution_id = NULL`, they were excluded from the access checks, causing all technician actions to be denied.

## Solution
Modified all technician access control queries in `server/routes/technician-service-requests.js` to:
1. Use `LEFT JOIN` instead of `INNER JOIN` for `technician_assignments`
2. Add conditional logic to allow access if `sr.is_walk_in = TRUE`

## Changes Made

### File: `server/routes/technician-service-requests.js`

#### 1. GET Single Request (Line ~105)
**Before:**
```sql
SELECT 1 FROM service_requests sr
JOIN technician_assignments ta ON sr.institution_id = ta.institution_id
WHERE sr.id = ? AND ta.technician_id = ? AND ta.is_active = TRUE
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT 1 FROM service_requests sr
LEFT JOIN technician_assignments ta ON sr.institution_id = ta.institution_id
WHERE sr.id = ? AND (
    (ta.technician_id = ? AND ta.is_active = TRUE) OR
    (sr.is_walk_in = TRUE)
)
```

#### 2. PUT Status Update (Line ~186)
**Before:**
```sql
SELECT sr.status FROM service_requests sr
JOIN technician_assignments ta ON sr.institution_id = ta.institution_id
WHERE sr.id = ? AND ta.technician_id = ? AND ta.is_active = TRUE
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT sr.status, sr.is_walk_in FROM service_requests sr
LEFT JOIN technician_assignments ta ON sr.institution_id = ta.institution_id
WHERE sr.id = ? AND (
    (ta.technician_id = ? AND ta.is_active = TRUE) OR
    (sr.is_walk_in = TRUE)
)
```

#### 3. PUT Complete Request (Line ~358)
Same pattern applied - changed JOIN to LEFT JOIN with walk-in condition.

#### 4. POST Report Issue (Line ~535)
Same pattern applied - changed JOIN to LEFT JOIN with walk-in condition.

#### 5. POST Request Reassignment (Line ~578)
Same pattern applied - changed JOIN to LEFT JOIN with walk-in condition.

## Technical Details

### Access Control Logic
```sql
WHERE sr.id = ? AND (
    (ta.technician_id = ? AND ta.is_active = TRUE) OR  -- Institution-based access
    (sr.is_walk_in = TRUE)                              -- Walk-in access for all techs
)
```

### Why LEFT JOIN?
- `INNER JOIN`: Only returns rows where both tables have matching data
- `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from left table (service_requests), even if right table (technician_assignments) has no match
- Essential for walk-in requests where `institution_id = NULL` means no matching rows in `technician_assignments`

## Walk-In Request Access Model

### Institution-Based Requests
- Technician must be assigned to the institution via `technician_assignments` table
- Access controlled by institution assignment

### Walk-In Requests
- Available to ALL technicians (no assignment required)
- Identified by `is_walk_in = TRUE` and `institution_id = NULL`
- Any technician can view, start, and complete walk-in requests

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Technician can view walk-in request details
- [x] Technician can start walk-in service (status → in_progress)
- [x] Technician can complete walk-in service
- [x] Technician can report issues on walk-in requests
- [x] Technician can request reassignment for walk-in requests
- [x] Institution-based requests still work correctly
- [x] Access control still prevents unauthorized access

## Affected Endpoints

All technician service request endpoints now support walk-in requests:
- `GET /api/technician/service-requests/:requestId`
- `PUT /api/technician/service-requests/:requestId/status`
- `PUT /api/technician/service-requests/:requestId/complete`
- `POST /api/technician/service-requests/:requestId/report-issue`
- `POST /api/technician/service-requests/:requestId/request-reassignment`

## Security Considerations

✅ **Maintained Security:**
- Institution-based requests still require proper technician assignment
- Walk-in requests are intentionally accessible to all technicians (business requirement)
- Authentication still required via `authenticateTechnician` middleware
- Request validation and status checks remain intact

✅ **No Breaking Changes:**
- Existing institution-based functionality unchanged
- Backward compatible with all existing requests
- No database schema changes required

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All technician actions now work correctly for both walk-in and institution-based service requests.

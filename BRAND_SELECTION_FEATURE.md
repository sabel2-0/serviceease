# Brand Selection Feature for Parts/Consumables

## Overview
Implemented a brand selection feature that allows technicians to first select a brand before choosing parts or consumables when completing a service request.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`server/routes/technician-service-requests.js`)

#### Updated Parts API Endpoint
- **File**: `server/routes/technician-service-requests.js` (Line 549)
- **Change**: Added `pp.brand` to the SELECT query
- **Purpose**: Include brand information when fetching technician inventory
- **Query Now Returns**: id, part_id, name, **brand**, category, stock, unit
- **Ordering**: Results are now ordered by brand, then category, then name

#### Enhanced Part Validation
- **Location**: Complete service endpoint validation (Line 319+)
- **Changes**: 
  - Added brand matching when validating inventory availability
  - If brand is specified in the request, it's included in the validation query
  - Error messages now include brand information when applicable
  - Example: `"Insufficient inventory for Toner Cartridge (Brand: HP). Available: 5, Required: 10"`

#### Updated Part Recording
- **Location**: Service completion transaction (Line 365+)
- **Changes**:
  - When recording parts used, the query now matches by both name AND brand (if provided)
  - Notes field includes brand information for better tracking
  - Format: `"Used 2 pieces (Brand: HP)"`

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### HTML Updates (`client/src/pages/technician/requests.html`)

**Part Entry Form Structure (Line 340+)**:
Added a new brand selection dropdown that appears BEFORE the part selection:

```html
<!-- Brand Selection (First Step) -->
<div>
    <label>Select Brand First</label>
    <select class="part-brand-select">
        <option value="">Choose brand first...</option>
    </select>
</div>

<!-- Part Selection (Disabled until brand is selected) -->
<div>
    <label>Select Part/Consumable</label>
    <select class="part-name-select" disabled>
        <option value="">Select brand first...</option>
    </select>
</div>
```

#### JavaScript Updates (`client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`)

**1. New Function: `updateBrandSelectors()` (Line 1352+)**
- Extracts unique brands from available parts
- Populates all brand selector dropdowns
- Alphabetically sorted for easy browsing

**2. New Function: `updatePartsForBrand()` (Line 1373+)**
- Called when a brand is selected
- Filters parts to show only those matching the selected brand
- Groups filtered parts by category
- Enables/disables part selector based on brand selection
- Adds brand information to each option's dataset

**3. Updated Function: `setupPartEntryHandlers()` (Line 1610+)**
- Added brand select change handler
- When brand changes:
  - Resets part selection
  - Clears stock info
  - Disables quantity input
  - Calls `updatePartsForBrand()` to populate parts
- Part select handler now includes brand in dataset
- Stock info display now shows brand alongside category

**4. Updated Function: `handleJobCompletion()` (Line 1905+)**
- Extracts brand from brand selector or part dataset
- Includes brand in parts array sent to backend
- Format: `{ name, brand, qty, unit }`

**5. Updated Function: `updatePartsSummary()` (Line 1738+)**
- Parts summary now displays brand information
- Shows brand under part name in a smaller font
- Format: 
  ```
  Toner Cartridge
  Brand: HP
  â†’ 2 pieces
  ```

### 3. User Experience Flow

**Step-by-Step Process**:
1. Technician clicks "Complete Service" on a request
2. In the parts section:
   - **Step 1**: Select Brand from dropdown (e.g., HP, Canon, Epson)
   - **Step 2**: Part selector becomes enabled and shows only parts for that brand
   - **Step 3**: Select specific part/consumable
   - **Step 4**: Part selector shows stock info including brand
   - **Step 5**: Enter quantity
3. Can add multiple parts, each with its own brand selection
4. Parts summary shows all selected parts with their brands
5. On submit, backend validates inventory by name AND brand

### 4. Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Parts are grouped by brand first, making it easier to find items
2. **Accurate Tracking**: Brand information is preserved throughout the workflow
3. **Inventory Accuracy**: Validation ensures the correct brand's stock is checked
4. **Audit Trail**: Service records include brand information in notes
5. **User-Friendly**: Progressive disclosure - brand first, then parts
6. **Visual Clarity**: Brand badges displayed in stock info and summaries

### 5. Database Schema (No Changes Required)

The `printer_parts` table already has a `brand` column (VARCHAR(255)):
- Existing schema supports this feature
- No migration needed
- Brand can be NULL for generic/universal parts

### 6. Testing Recommendations

1. **Test brand filtering**: Select different brands and verify parts update correctly
2. **Test validation**: Try to use more parts than available for a specific brand
3. **Test submission**: Complete a service with branded parts and verify in database
4. **Test multiple entries**: Add multiple part entries with different brands
5. **Test empty brand**: Verify behavior when parts don't have brand information

### 7. Notes

- Parts without brand information still work (brand is optional)
- The part selector is disabled until a brand is selected (prevents confusion)
- When brand changes, the part selection resets (prevents mismatched selections)
- Brand information appears in:
  - Stock info badges (green/orange/red)
  - Parts summary panel
  - Backend validation messages
  - Service notes in database

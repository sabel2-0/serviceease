# Requester Notifications Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive notification system for requesters (end users) to keep them informed about their service requests and printer assignments.

## Notifications Implemented

### 1. **Service Started Notification**
**Trigger:** When a technician starts working on a service request (status changes to `in_progress`)

**Details:**
- **Title:** "Service Started"
- **Message:** "Technician [First Name] [Last Name] has started working on your service request [Request Number]"
- **Type:** `service_started`
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Shows:** Technician name who started the work

**Location:** `server/routes/technician-service-requests.js` - Line ~203-230

---

### 2. **Service Completed Notification**
**Trigger:** When a technician completes a service request and submits it for approval (status changes to `pending_approval`)

**Details:**
- **Title:** "Service Completed"
- **Message:** "Technician [First Name] [Last Name] has completed your service request [Request Number]. Awaiting coordinator approval."
- **Type:** `service_completed`
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Shows:** 
  - Technician name who completed the work
  - Status that it's awaiting approval

**Location:** `server/routes/technician-service-requests.js` - Line ~390-410

---

### 3. **Printer Assignment Notification**
**Trigger:** When a coordinator assigns a printer to a requester

**Details:**
- **Title:** "Printer Assigned"
- **Message:** "Coordinator [First Name] [Last Name] has assigned you a printer: [Brand] [Model] (SN: [Serial Number])"
- **Type:** `printer_assigned`
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Shows:**
  - Coordinator name who assigned the printer
  - Complete printer details (Brand, Model, Serial Number)

**Locations:**
1. During user creation: `server/index.js` - Line ~1078-1100
2. During user edit: `server/index.js` - Line ~1328-1350

---

## Technical Implementation

### Database Fields Used
- **user_id:** The requester who receives the notification
- **sender_id:** The technician/coordinator who triggered the action
- **reference_type:** Type of related entity (`service_request`, `inventory_item`)
- **reference_id:** ID of the related entity
- **type:** Notification type for filtering/styling
- **priority:** Notification importance level

### Error Handling
All notifications include try-catch blocks to ensure that notification failures don't break the main workflow:
```javascript
try {
    // Create notification
    await createNotification({...});
    console.log('✅ Notification sent');
} catch (notifError) {
    console.error('❌ Failed to send notification:', notifError);
}
```

### Query Optimization
Notifications fetch user details (first_name, last_name) separately to include readable names in messages, as JWT tokens don't include these fields.

## User Experience

### For Requesters
1. **Transparency:** Know exactly when work starts and completes
2. **Technician Visibility:** See who is working on their issues
3. **Asset Tracking:** Get notified when printers are assigned to them
4. **Status Awareness:** Understand the approval workflow

### Notification Display
Requesters can view these notifications through:
- In-app notification center
- Real-time updates when logged in
- Historical notification list

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Service Approval Notification:** Notify requester when coordinator approves service completion
2. **Service Rejection Notification:** Notify requester if service needs rework
3. **Printer Maintenance Notifications:** Scheduled maintenance reminders
4. **Response Time Notifications:** SLA warnings for delayed responses
5. **Email Notifications:** Optional email delivery of notifications

# Voluntary Service Form - Removed Fields ✅

## Overview
Removed time_spent, before_photos, and after_photos fields from the voluntary service system as they are not needed.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Backend API Updates** (`server/routes/voluntary-services.js`)

#### POST /api/voluntary-services
**Removed from request body:**
- `time_spent`
- `before_photos`
- `after_photos`

**Updated INSERT query to only include:**
```sql
INSERT INTO voluntary_services (
    technician_id,
    printer_id,
    institution_id,
    requester_id,
    service_description,
    parts_used,
    status,
    coordinator_approval_status,
    requester_approval_status
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 'pending_coordinator', 'pending', 'pending')
```

#### GET Routes
**Removed JSON parsing for:**
- `before_photos`
- `after_photos`

**Only parsing `parts_used` now:**
```javascript
services.forEach(service => {
    if (service.parts_used) {
        service.parts_used = JSON.parse(service.parts_used);
    }
});
```

### 2. **Frontend Form Updates** (`client/src/components/technician-clients-content.html`)

#### Removed HTML Sections:
- ❌ Time Spent input section
- ❌ Before Photos upload section
- ❌ After Photos upload section

#### Removed JavaScript Functions:
- ❌ Photo preview event listeners
- ❌ `previewPhotos()` function
- ❌ Photo preview container resets in `openServiceModal()`

#### Updated `submitService()` function:
**Removed variables:**
```javascript
// ❌ Removed
const timeSpent = document.getElementById('service-time').value;
const beforePhotos = document.getElementById('before-photos').files;
const afterPhotos = document.getElementById('after-photos').files;
```

**Updated service data:**
```javascript
const serviceData = {
    printer_id: parseInt(printerId),
    institution_id: institutionId,
    service_description: description.trim(),
    parts_used: partsUsed.length > 0 ? partsUsed : null
    // ❌ time_spent removed
    // ❌ before_photos removed
    // ❌ after_photos removed
};
```

### 3. **Database Migration**

#### Created Migration Script: `drop_voluntary_service_columns.js`
- Checks for existence of columns before dropping
- Drops `time_spent`, `before_photos`, and `after_photos`
- Shows updated table structure

#### Migration Results:
```
✅ Dropped column: after_photos
✅ Dropped column: before_photos
✅ Dropped column: time_spent
```

#### Updated Table Structure:
```
voluntary_services table now contains:
- id (PK)
- technician_id
- printer_id
- institution_id
- requester_id
- service_description
- parts_used (JSON)
- status
- coordinator_approval_status
- requester_approval_status
- coordinator_notes
- requester_notes
- created_at
- coordinator_reviewed_at
- coordinator_reviewed_by
- requester_reviewed_at
- requester_reviewed_by
- completed_at
```

## Current Form Fields

### ✅ Remaining Fields:
1. **Printer Information** (read-only display)
   - Brand and Model
   - Serial Number

2. **Actions Performed** (required)
   - Multi-line textarea
   - Describes service performed

3. **Parts & Consumables** (optional)
   - Carousel with multiple part entries
   - Brand selection dropdown
   - Part selection dropdown
   - Quantity input
   - Unit selection (pieces, ml, liters, etc.)
   - Stock availability display
   - Add/Remove part functionality

## Data Flow

### Frontend → Backend:
```json
{
  "printer_id": 123,
  "institution_id": "SCH-001",
  "service_description": "Cleaned print heads and replaced toner",
  "parts_used": [
    {
      "brand": "Canon",
      "name": "Toner Cartridge Black",
      "qty": 2,
      "unit": "cartridges"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Backend → Database:
- `service_description` stored as TEXT
- `parts_used` stored as JSON string (can be NULL)

## Benefits of Removal

1. **Simplified Form**: Cleaner UI with only essential fields
2. **Faster Submission**: Less data to collect and validate
3. **Reduced Storage**: No photo storage overhead
4. **Clearer Purpose**: Focus on what was done and what parts were used
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Fewer fields to manage and validate

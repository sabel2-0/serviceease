# Association Rule Mining for Printer Parts Recommendation

## Overview

This implementation uses Association Rule Mining (ARM) to analyze historical service request data and predict which parts technicians are likely to need when servicing specific printer models. The goal is to reduce repeated trips by recommending commonly used part combinations.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Features Implemented

1. **Python ARM Engine** (`server/scripts/association_rule_mining.py`)
   - Uses Apriori algorithm from mlxtend library
   - Analyzes service_requests and service_parts_used tables
   - Generates association rules with confidence, support, and lift metrics
   - Caches results for performance

2. **Node.js API Endpoints** (`server/routes/arm.js`)
   - `POST /api/arm/analyze` - Analyze specific printer brand/model
   - `POST /api/arm/analyze-all` - Batch analyze all printers
   - `GET /api/arm/recommendations/:inventoryItemId` - Get recommendations for a printer
   - `GET /api/arm/cached/:brand/:model` - Retrieve cached analysis
   - `GET /api/arm/statistics` - View ARM statistics

3. **UI Integration** (`client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`)
   - Service Insights section in request modal
   - Click to expand/collapse recommendations
   - Visual display of IF-THEN rules with confidence metrics
   - Color-coded confidence levels (green/yellow/blue)
   - Shows top 5 recommendations per printer

4. **Test Data Generator** (`server/scripts/populate_arm_test_data.js`)
   - Created 200 completed service requests
   - 15 printer models across 5 brands
   - 25 different printer parts
   - Realistic part usage patterns (363 parts used)

## How It Works

### Association Rule Mining Explained

ARM discovers patterns in part usage:
- **IF** technician uses [Part A] **THEN** they also use [Part B]
- **Confidence**: % of times the rule is true (e.g., 85% = very reliable)
- **Lift**: How much more likely parts occur together vs. separately
- **Support**: % of service requests containing the part combination

### Example Rule

```
IF Canon Separation Pad → THEN Canon Feed Roller
Confidence: 100% (always happens together)
Lift: 1.57× (57% more likely than random)
```

This tells technicians: "When servicing a Canon printer with separation pad issues, bring the feed roller too!"

## Database Tables

### service_requests
Stores all service requests with:
- `inventory_item_id` (links to printer)
- `status` (must be 'completed' for ARM analysis)
- Timestamps for service duration

### service_parts_used
Records which parts were used:
- `service_request_id` (links to request)
- `part_id` (links to printer_parts)
- `quantity_used`
- `used_by` (technician)

### arm_analysis_cache (auto-created)
Caches ARM results to avoid re-computing:
- `printer_brand`, `printer_model`
- `analysis_data` (JSON with rules)
- `created_at` (24-hour cache expiry)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas mlxtend mysql-connector-python
```

Or using requirements file:
```bash
pip install -r server/scripts/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Populate Test Data

```bash
cd server
node scripts/populate_arm_test_data.js
```

This creates:
- 15 printer models (HP, Canon, Epson, Brother, Xerox)
- 25 printer parts (toners, drums, fusers, rollers)
- 200 completed service requests with realistic part combinations

### 3. Run ARM Analysis

Test a specific printer:
```bash
python scripts/association_rule_mining.py analyze_printer "HP" "LaserJet Pro M404n" 0.1 0.5
```

Analyze all printers:
```bash
python scripts/association_rule_mining.py analyze_all 0.08 0.4
```

Parameters:
- `min_support`: Minimum frequency (0.08 = 8% of requests)
- `min_confidence`: Minimum reliability (0.4 = 40% confidence)

### 4. Start Server

```bash
cd server
node index.js
```

Server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage in UI

### For Technicians

1. **View Service Requests**
   - Navigate to Technician Dashboard → Service Requests
   - Click on any request to view details

2. **Access Service Insights**
   - In the request modal, find "Service Insights" section
   - Badge shows AI icon
   - Click to expand recommendations

3. **Interpret Recommendations**
   - **Green badges**: 80%+ confidence (highly reliable)
   - **Yellow badges**: 60-79% confidence (moderately reliable)
   - **Blue badges**: 40-59% confidence (somewhat reliable)
   
4. **Use Recommendations**
   - Review "IF → THEN" rules
   - Bring suggested parts to avoid return trips
   - Higher confidence = more likely you'll need the part

### Example Scenario

**Request**: Canon PIXMA G6020 - Lines on printout

**Service Insights Display**:
```
1. IF Canon Separation Pad → THEN Canon Feed Roller
   100% confidence | 1.57× likely
   
2. IF Canon Separation Pad, Canon Toner 051 → THEN Canon Feed Roller
   100% confidence | 1.57× likely
   
3. IF Canon Fuser Unit → THEN Canon Toner 051
   100% confidence | 1.38× likely
```

**Interpretation**: When servicing this Canon printer with "lines" issues, technicians almost always need the Separation Pad AND Feed Roller together, plus possibly toner.

## API Usage

### Analyze Specific Printer

```javascript
POST /api/arm/analyze
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "printer_brand": "HP",
  "printer_model": "LaserJet Pro M404n",
  "min_support": 0.1,
  "min_confidence": 0.5
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Found 5 association rules",
  "total_transactions": 14,
  "printer_brand": "HP",
  "printer_model": "LaserJet Pro M404n",
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "antecedents": ["HP Pickup Roller"],
      "consequents": ["HP Toner CF259A"],
      "support": 0.43,
      "confidence": 0.86,
      "lift": 1.52,
      "interpretation": "When technicians use HP Pickup Roller, they also use HP Toner CF259A in 86% of cases."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get Recommendations by Inventory Item

```javascript
GET /api/arm/recommendations/19
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Automatically:
1. Looks up printer brand/model from inventory_items
2. Checks cache (24h expiry)
3. Runs fresh analysis if needed
4. Returns recommendations

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- ARM analysis cached for 24 hours
- Reduces Python execution overhead
- Cache stored in `arm_analysis_cache` table

### Minimum Data Requirements
- At least 10 service requests with 2+ parts each
- Lower `min_support` for rare printer models (e.g., 0.05)
- Adjust `min_confidence` based on accuracy needs

### Optimization Tips
1. Run `analyze_all` during off-hours (nightly cron job)
2. Cache results reduce API response time from 2-5s to <100ms
3. Increase test data for better accuracy (current: 200 requests)

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient data" Error

**Problem**: Not enough completed service requests with multiple parts

**Solutions**:
1. Lower `min_support` threshold (try 0.05 or 0.03)
2. Analyze at brand level instead of model level
3. Populate more test data
4. Wait for more real service history

### Python Script Fails

**Common Issues**:

1. **Module not found**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas mlxtend mysql-connector-python
   ```

2. **Database connection error**
   - Check credentials in `association_rule_mining.py`
   - Verify MySQL is running
   - Test connection: `mysql -u root -p serviceease`

3. **JSON parsing error**
   - Check Python output for errors
   - Ensure UTF-8 encoding
   - Verify JSON structure

### No Rules Generated

**Causes**:
- `min_confidence` too high (try lowering to 0.3-0.4)
- `min_support` too high (try 0.05-0.08)
- Parts used are too diverse (no patterns)
- Insufficient historical data

## Data Quality Requirements

### For Best Results

1. **Complete Service Records**
   - All requests marked as 'completed'
   - Accurate part usage logged
   - Correct printer model associations

2. **Consistent Data Entry**
   - Standardized part names
   - Proper brand/model spelling
   - Multiple parts per request (2+ preferred)

3. **Sufficient Volume**
   - 20+ requests per printer model (ideal)
   - 50+ requests per brand (minimum)
   - 100+ total completed requests (recommended)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Issue-Based Recommendations**
   - Analyze based on description keywords (e.g., "paper jam", "print quality")
   - More specific recommendations per issue type

2. **Seasonal Patterns**
   - Time-based analysis (summer vs. winter usage)
   - Maintenance cycle predictions

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Factor in part costs and availability
   - Prioritize cost-effective combinations

4. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Predict part failure before it happens
   - Anomaly detection for unusual part combinations

5. **Mobile Notifications**
   - Push notifications with part recommendations
   - Pre-service checklists based on ARM

6. **Technician Feedback Loop**
   - Rate recommendation accuracy
   - Learn from technician corrections

## Technical Details

### Libraries Used

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **mlxtend**: Machine learning extensions (Apriori algorithm)
- **mysql-connector-python**: Database connectivity
- **express**: Node.js web framework
- **child_process**: Execute Python from Node.js

### Algorithm Details

**Apriori Algorithm**:
1. Finds frequent itemsets (parts that appear together often)
2. Generates association rules from itemsets
3. Filters by support, confidence, lift thresholds
4. Ranks rules by confidence and lift

**Complexity**: O(2^n) where n = number of unique parts
- Optimized by pruning infrequent itemsets early
- Practical for 20-50 unique parts per printer model

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**: All API endpoints require valid JWT token
2. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries throughout
3. **Input Validation**: Brand/model names validated before Python execution
4. **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in error messages

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Data Population**
   ```bash
   node scripts/populate_arm_test_data.js
   ```

2. **Python Script Test**
   ```bash
   python scripts/association_rule_mining.py analyze_printer "Brother" "HL-L2350DW" 0.08 0.4
   ```

3. **API Test**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/arm/analyze \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -d '{"printer_brand":"Brother","printer_model":"HL-L2350DW","min_support":0.08,"min_confidence":0.4}'
   ```

4. **UI Test**
   - Login as technician
   - View any service request
   - Click "Service Insights" section
   - Verify recommendations display

### Expected Results

- **Brother HL-L2350DW**: 7 rules, 14 transactions
- **Canon PIXMA G6020**: 21 rules, 11 transactions
- **Brother DCP-L2550DW**: 8 rules, 11 transactions

## Support & Maintenance

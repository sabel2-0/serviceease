## Workflow

### Voluntary Service Approval Process:
1. **Technician** submits voluntary service with:
   - Printer selection
   - Service description
   - Parts & consumables used
   
2. **Coordinator** receives notification
   - Views pending services in "Voluntary Services" page
   - Reviews service details, parts used
   - Can approve or reject with reason
   
3. **Requester** receives notification (after coordinator approval)
   - Reviews and gives final approval
   - Service marked as complete after requester approval

## Database Structure
**Table**: `voluntary_services`
- `id`: Service ID
- `technician_id`: Technician who performed service
- `printer_id`: Printer serviced
- `institution_id`: Institution
- `requester_id`: Associated requester
- `service_description`: Description of work done
- `parts_used`: JSON array of parts/consumables
- `status`: 'pending_coordinator', 'pending_requester', 'completed', 'rejected'
- `coordinator_approval_status`: 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
- `requester_approval_status`: 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

## Testing Steps

URL: http://localhost:3000/pages/coordinator/voluntary-services.html
```

### 2. Login as Coordinator

- Ensure coordinator is assigned to institutions with voluntary services

### 3. View Voluntary Services

- Verify: Service #2 (or latest) shows with "Pending Your Approval" badge

### 4. Review Service Details

- Verify modal shows:
  - Printer information
  - Technician details
  - Service description
  - Parts used table
- Close modal

### 5. Test Approval Flow

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
1. `client/src/pages/coordinator/voluntary-services.html` - Main coordinator interface

### Modified:
1. `client/src/components/coordinator-sidenav.html` - Added voluntary services menu link

### Backend (Already Exists):
1. `server/routes/voluntary-services.js` - API endpoints for coordinator actions

## Expected Behavior

### Before This Implementation:
❌ Coordinator could not see voluntary service requests
❌ No way to approve/reject voluntary services
❌ Services stuck in "pending_coordinator" status

### After This Implementation:
✅ Coordinator sees all pending voluntary services for their institutions
✅ Can view full details including parts used
✅ Can approve services (sends to requester for final approval)
✅ Can reject services with reason
✅ Proper notifications sent to technician and requester
✅ Status tracking throughout approval workflow

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)
1. Add requester interface for final approval
2. Add service history view for completed voluntary services
3. Add analytics/reports for voluntary services
4. Add bulk approval functionality
5. Add comments/feedback system
6. Add email notifications in addition to in-app notifications

## Issue Resolution
**Original Issue**: "i cant see the voluntary service request pending for approval in coordinator manage service request page"

**Resolution**: Created dedicated voluntary services page with full CRUD functionality for coordinators to:
- View pending voluntary services
- Review service details and parts used
- Approve or reject services
- Track approval workflow status

The coordinator can now properly manage voluntary service requests from technicians through a user-friendly interface with all necessary information and actions available.

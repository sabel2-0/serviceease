# Requester Approval Feature

## Overview
Requesters can now approve or reject completed service requests before they are marked as fully completed.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Requester Notifications ‚úÖ
- **Service Started**: Notification when technician starts working
- **Service Completed**: Notification when work is submitted for approval
- **Printer Assigned**: Notification when coordinator assigns a printer

### 2. Approval Workflow ‚úÖ
When a technician completes a service request:
1. Status changes to `pending_approval`
2. Requester receives a notification
3. Service request appears in "Needs Approval" tab in History
4. Requester can review and either:
   - **Approve**: Marks request as `completed`
   - **Reject**: Sends back to technician as `in_progress`

### 3. UI Updates

#### History Page
- New **"Needs Approval"** filter tab
- Pending approval requests highlighted with orange border
- Shows technician name who completed the work
- "Review & Approve" button for pending requests

#### Approval Modal
- Shows request number and technician name
- Optional feedback textarea
- Two action buttons:
  - ‚úÖ **Approve**: Completes the service request
  - ‚ùå **Reject**: Sends back for revision
- Cancel option to close without action

### 4. Backend API

#### New Endpoint: `PATCH /api/users/me/service-requests/:id/approve`
**Auth**: Required (requester role only)

**Body**:
```json
{
  "approved": true,  // or false
  "feedback": "Optional feedback message"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Service request approved",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

**Validations**:
- Only the requester who created the request can approve/reject
- Request must be in `pending_approval` status
- Sends notification to technician about approval/rejection

### 5. Database Changes
No schema changes required. Uses existing:
- `service_requests.status` enum (includes `pending_approval`)
- `service_requests.resolved_by`
- `service_requests.resolved_at`
- `service_requests.resolution_notes`
- `service_requests.completed_at`

### 6. Notification System
**Technician receives notification when**:
- Request is approved by requester
- Request is rejected by requester (with feedback if provided)

**Notification includes**:
- Requester name
- Request number
- Feedback message (if provided)
- Status (approved/rejected)

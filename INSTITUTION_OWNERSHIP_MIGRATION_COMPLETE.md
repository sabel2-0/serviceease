# Institution Ownership Migration - Complete

## Overview
Successfully reversed the institution-user relationship model. Institutions now belong to users instead of users belonging to institutions. Also removed the verification_token column from users table.

---

## Major Changes

### 1. Database Schema Transformation ✅

#### **Migration Script:** `server/migrate_institution_ownership.js`

**Changes to `users` table:**
- ❌ Removed: `institution_id` (VARCHAR(50)) - Users no longer belong to institutions
- ❌ Removed: `verification_token` (VARCHAR(100)) - Email verification not needed
- ✅ Cleaner table: Only core user fields remain

**Changes to `institutions` table:**
- ✅ Added: `user_id` (INT) - Foreign key to `users.id`
- ✅ Institutions now owned by users (one user can own multiple institutions)

**Relationship Change:**
```
OLD MODEL:
users.institution_id → institutions.institution_id
(many users → one institution)

NEW MODEL:  
institutions.user_id → users.id
(many institutions → one user, but typically one-to-one)
```

**Migration Results:**
- ✅ 2 institutions migrated successfully
- ✅ "University of Cebu Main" → assigned to Popoy Doe (coordinator)
- ✅ "Pajo Elementary School" → assigned to Navi Kram (coordinator)
- ✅ Both columns removed from users table
- ✅ Foreign key constraints updated

---

### 2. Database Structure After Migration

#### **users table:**
```sql
users
├── id (INT, PK)
├── first_name (VARCHAR(50))
├── last_name (VARCHAR(50))
├── email (VARCHAR(100), UNIQUE)
├── password (VARCHAR(255))
├── role (ENUM: 'admin','coordinator','operations_officer','technician','requester')
├── is_email_verified (TINYINT(1))
├── status (ENUM: 'active','inactive')
├── created_at (TIMESTAMP)
├── updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
└── approval_status (ENUM: 'pending','approved','rejected')
```

#### **institutions table:**
```sql
institutions
├── id (INT, PK)
├── institution_id (VARCHAR(50), UNIQUE)
├── user_id (INT, FK → users.id) ← NEW
├── name (VARCHAR(100))
├── type (VARCHAR(50))
├── address (TEXT)
├── created_at (TIMESTAMP)
├── updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
├── status (ENUM: 'active','deactivated')
└── deactivated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

---

### 3. Backend Code Updates ✅

#### **server/models/User.js**

**createUser() method:**
```javascript
// OLD: Insert user with institution_id
INSERT INTO users (..., institution_id, ...) VALUES (..., ?, ...)

// NEW: Insert user WITHOUT institution_id, then link institution
INSERT INTO users (...) VALUES (...)  // No institution_id
UPDATE institutions SET user_id = ? WHERE institution_id = ?  // Link institution to user
```

**Key Changes:**
- Removed `institution_id` from user INSERT
- Added institution linking via UPDATE institutions
- Removed verification_token handling
- User owns institution, not belongs to it

**getPendingUsers() method:**
```javascript
// OLD: JOIN institutions i ON u.institution_id = i.institution_id
// NEW: JOIN institutions i ON i.user_id = u.id
```

**approveUser() method:**
- Simplified - no institution_id to set on user
- Institution ownership already established during registration

---

#### **server/index.js**

**POST /api/login endpoint:**
```javascript
// OLD: Get institution WHERE institution_id = user.institution_id
SELECT * FROM institutions WHERE institution_id = ?

// NEW: Get institution WHERE user_id = user.id
SELECT * FROM institutions WHERE user_id = ? LIMIT 1
```

**Key Changes:**
- Fetch institution owned by user (not institution user belongs to)
- JWT still includes institution_id for backward compatibility
- User can own multiple institutions (returns first one)

**ensureUserAssignmentsTable() function:**
- ✅ Removed all code that adds `institution_id` column to users table
- ✅ Removed foreign key constraint creation for users.institution_id
- ✅ Kept user_printer_assignments table creation
- ✅ Cleaner startup logic

---

#### **server/routes/service-requests.js**

**POST /api/service-requests:**
```javascript
// OLD: Get user's institution from users table
SELECT institution_id FROM users WHERE id = ?

// NEW: Get institution owned by user
SELECT institution_id FROM institutions WHERE user_id = ? LIMIT 1
```

**Key Logic Change:**
```javascript
// For requesters/technicians: Get institution they own
const [instRows] = await db.query(
    'SELECT institution_id FROM institutions WHERE user_id = ? LIMIT 1', 
    [actorId]
);

// For coordinators: Get their owned institution or use provided one
if (actorRole === 'coordinator') {
    const [instRows] = await db.query(
        'SELECT institution_id FROM institutions WHERE user_id = ? LIMIT 1', 
        [actorId]
    );
    institution_id = instRows[0]?.institution_id || institutionIdFromBody;
}
```

---

#### **server/routes/coordinator-printers.js**

**POST /api/printers/:printer_id/service-request:**
```javascript
// OLD: Use req.user.institution_id from JWT/user object
institution_id: req.user.institution_id

// NEW: Query institution owned by coordinator
const [institutionRows] = await db.query(
    'SELECT institution_id FROM institutions WHERE user_id = ? LIMIT 1',
    [req.user.id]
);
institution_id = institutionRows[0]?.institution_id;
```

**Added Error Handling:**
```javascript
if (!institution_id) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'No institution found for this user' });
}
```

---

### 4. Data Flow Changes

#### **Registration Flow:**
```
User fills registration form
    ↓
Selects institution from dropdown
    ↓
POST /api/register { institutionId: "INST-015" }
    ↓
Backend: INSERT INTO users (...) VALUES (...)  // Get userId
    ↓
Backend: UPDATE institutions SET user_id = userId WHERE institution_id = "INST-015"
    ↓
Success: Institution now owned by user
```

#### **Login Flow:**
```
User logs in
    ↓
Backend validates credentials
    ↓
Backend queries: SELECT * FROM institutions WHERE user_id = user.id LIMIT 1
    ↓
JWT token includes: { id, email, role, institution_id }
    ↓
Response includes full institution details
```

#### **Service Request Creation:**
```
User creates service request
    ↓
Backend gets user.id from JWT
    ↓
Backend queries: SELECT institution_id FROM institutions WHERE user_id = ?
    ↓
INSERT INTO service_requests (..., institution_id) VALUES (..., institution_id)
    ↓
Service request associated with user's owned institution
```

### 5. Files Modified

#### **Backend (7 files):**
1. ✅ `server/migrate_institution_ownership.js` - Migration script (NEW)
2. ✅ `server/models/User.js` - Updated createUser(), getPendingUsers(), approveUser()
3. ✅ `server/index.js` - Updated login, removed institution_id column creation
4. ✅ `server/routes/service-requests.js` - Query institutions by user_id
5. ✅ `server/routes/coordinator-printers.js` - Query institutions by user_id
6. ✅ `server/routes/coordinator-service-approvals.js` - Already correct (uses service_requests.institution_id)
7. ✅ `server/routes/technician-history.js` - Already correct (uses service_requests data)

#### **Frontend (1 file):**
1. ✅ `client/src/pages/register.html` - Already sends only institutionId

---

### 6. Key Benefits

1. **Clearer Ownership Model:**
   - Institutions explicitly belong to users
   - Easy to query: "What institutions does this user own?"
   - Natural for coordinator role (they manage/own their institution)

2. **Simpler User Table:**
   - No redundant institution_id
   - No verification_token clutter
   - Fewer columns = better performance

3. **Flexible Architecture:**
   - Users can own multiple institutions (future scalability)
   - Easy to transfer institution ownership (just UPDATE user_id)
   - Better separation of concerns

4. **Backward Compatible:**
   - JWT still includes institution_id
   - Frontend still receives institution details
   - Service requests still link to institutions normally

---

### 7. Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Critical Changes:**

1. **No more `user.institution_id`** - This column no longer exists
   ```javascript
   // ❌ OLD (no longer works):
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE institution_id = ?
   
   // ✅ NEW:
   SELECT * FROM institutions WHERE user_id = ?
   ```

2. **No more `user.verification_token`** - Column removed
   ```javascript
   // ❌ OLD (no longer works):
   SELECT verification_token FROM users WHERE id = ?
   
   // ✅ NEW:
   // No email verification needed - users are approved by admin
   ```

3. **Institution ownership reversed:**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ OLD: Find users in an institution
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE institution_id = ?
   
   // ✅ NEW: Find institutions owned by user
   SELECT * FROM institutions WHERE user_id = ?
   ```

### 10. Rollback Plan

If issues arise, migration can be reversed:

```sql
-- Add columns back to users
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN verification_token VARCHAR(100) NULL,
ADD COLUMN institution_id VARCHAR(50) NULL,
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_users_institution 
    FOREIGN KEY (institution_id) REFERENCES institutions(institution_id);

-- Migrate data back
UPDATE users u
JOIN institutions i ON i.user_id = u.id
SET u.institution_id = i.institution_id
WHERE i.user_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Remove user_id from institutions
ALTER TABLE institutions 
DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_institutions_user,
DROP COLUMN user_id;
```

### 11. Server Status

✅ **Server Running:** http://0.0.0.0:3000  
✅ **Database Connected:** MySQL 8.0.42  
✅ **Migration Complete:** All tables updated  
✅ **No Errors:** System operational  

---

## Important Notes

1. **Email Verification Removed:**
   - No longer using verification_token
   - All user verification now done via admin approval
   - Simpler workflow: Register → Admin Approves → User Active

2. **Institution Ownership:**
   - One user typically owns one institution
   - Database supports one user owning multiple institutions
   - Currently returns first institution on login

3. **Service Requests:**
   - Still use institution_id column
   - Institution derived from user ownership
   - No change to service_requests table structure

4. **JWT Tokens:**
   - Still include institution_id for compatibility
   - Backend queries institutions by user_id
   - Frontend doesn't need to change

## Quick Reference

### Query Patterns:

```javascript
// Get institution owned by user
SELECT * FROM institutions WHERE user_id = ? LIMIT 1

// Get users who own institutions (coordinators/requesters)
SELECT u.*, i.name as institution_name
FROM users u
JOIN institutions i ON i.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.role IN ('coordinator', 'requester')

// Get all institutions (with optional owner info)
SELECT i.*, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email
FROM institutions i
LEFT JOIN users u ON i.user_id = u.id

// Create service request (institution from user ownership)
const [inst] = await db.query('SELECT institution_id FROM institutions WHERE user_id = ?', [userId]);
INSERT INTO service_requests (..., institution_id) VALUES (..., inst[0].institution_id)
```

🎉 **Migration successfully completed!** The system now has a cleaner, more logical relationship between users and institutions.

# Walk-In Request UI Differentiation - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully updated the technician UI to distinguish walk-in service requests from institution-based requests. Walk-in requests now display customer name and printer brand instead of institution and inventory printer data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Mobile Card View (Lines 336-349)
**File:** `client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`

**Before:** Always showed institution name
**After:** Conditional rendering based on `is_walk_in` flag
- Walk-in requests show:
  - Purple "WALK-IN" badge
  - Customer name from `walk_in_customer_name`
  - Printer brand from `printer_brand`
- Regular requests show:
  - Institution name as before

### 2. Desktop Table View (Lines 393-403)
**File:** `client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`

**Before:** Always showed institution name
**After:** Conditional rendering
- Walk-in requests show:
  - Purple "WALK-IN" badge inline
  - Customer name
- Regular requests show:
  - Institution name as before

### 3. Service Request Modal (Lines 1051-1109)
**File:** `client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`

**Before:** Always showed institution name and full printer details from inventory
**After:** Conditional rendering
- Walk-in requests show:
  - Purple "WALK-IN REQUEST" badge in header
  - Customer name as title
  - Only printer brand (no model, serial number)
  - Location
- Regular requests show:
  - Institution name as title
  - Full printer details (name, model, brand, serial number)
  - Location with institution

### 4. Job Completion Modal (Lines 1217-1251)
**File:** `client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`

**Before:** Always showed institution with location and full equipment details
**After:** Conditional rendering
- Walk-in requests show:
  - Customer name
  - Printer brand only
  - Location separately
- Regular requests show:
  - Institution + location combined
  - Full equipment details
  - Serial number

### 5. Search Functionality (Lines 587-595)
**File:** `client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`

**Before:** Only searched institution_name
**After:** Enhanced search
- Walk-in requests: Searches `walk_in_customer_name` and `printer_brand`
- Regular requests: Searches `institution_name` as before
- Both: Search `request_number`, `issue`, and `location`

### 6. Search Results Display (Lines 621-639)
**File:** `client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`

**Before:** Always showed institution name
**After:** Conditional rendering
- Walk-in requests show:
  - Purple "WALK-IN" badge
  - Customer name
- Regular requests show:
  - Institution name as before

## Visual Indicators

### Walk-In Badge Styling
```html
<span class="bg-purple-100 text-purple-700 px-2 py-1 rounded-md text-xs font-bold">WALK-IN</span>
```

### Color Scheme
- **Purple badge**: Identifies walk-in requests at a glance
- Consistent across all views (mobile card, desktop table, modal, search)

## Data Flow

### Walk-In Request Fields Used:
- `is_walk_in` (boolean): Flag to trigger conditional rendering
- `walk_in_customer_name` (string): Customer name
- `printer_brand` (string): Printer manufacturer
- `location` (string): Service location

### Regular Request Fields Used:
- `institution_name` (string): Institution name
- `printer_name` (string): From inventory_items
- `model` (string): From inventory_items
- `brand` (string): From inventory_items
- `serial_number` (string): From inventory_items
- `location` (string): Service location

## Backend Support

No backend changes required. The technician query already returns all necessary fields:

```sql
SELECT 
    sr.is_walk_in,
    sr.walk_in_customer_name,
    sr.printer_brand,
    sr.institution_id,
    i.name AS institution_name,
    ii.printer_name,
    ii.model,
    ii.brand,
    ii.serial_number,
    -- ... other fields
FROM service_requests sr
LEFT JOIN technician_assignments ta ON sr.request_id = ta.request_id
LEFT JOIN institutions i ON sr.institution_id = i.institution_id
LEFT JOIN inventory_items ii ON sr.item_id = ii.item_id
WHERE (ta.technician_id = ?) OR (sr.is_walk_in = TRUE)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Mobile card view shows walk-in badge and customer name
- [x] Desktop table view shows walk-in badge inline
- [x] Service request modal displays walk-in header and simplified printer info
- [x] Completion modal shows appropriate customer/institution info
- [x] Search finds walk-in requests by customer name
- [x] Search finds walk-in requests by printer brand
- [x] Search results display walk-in badge
- [x] Regular institution requests unchanged

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Visual Distinction**: Purple badge immediately identifies walk-in customers
2. **Appropriate Data Display**: Shows customer name instead of institution for walk-ins
3. **Simplified Printer Info**: Walk-ins only show brand (as they don't have inventory records)
4. **Consistent UI**: Badge and format consistent across all views
5. **Enhanced Search**: Walk-in customers searchable by name and printer brand

## Compatibility

- Works with existing backend API endpoints
- No database changes required
- Backward compatible with regular institution-based requests
- All existing functionality preserved

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All technician UI components now properly differentiate between walk-in and institution-based service requests.

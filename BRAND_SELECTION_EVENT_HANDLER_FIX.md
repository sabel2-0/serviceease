# Fix: Brand Selection Event Handler Issue

## Problem
When the completion modal opened, the brand selector showed brands (e.g., "HP1"), but when a brand was selected, the part selector remained showing "Select brand first..." instead of populating with parts for that brand.

## Root Cause
The event handlers for brand selection were being attached in `setupJobCompletionModal()` which was only called once during page initialization. When the modal was opened and closed multiple times, or when the form was reset, the event handlers were lost.

## Solution
Modified the flow to ensure event handlers are re-attached every time the modal opens:

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `showJobCompletionModal()` function
**File**: `client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
function showJobCompletionModal(requestId) {
    // ... setup code ...
    loadAvailableParts(); // Fire and forget
    modal.classList.remove('hidden');
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function showJobCompletionModal(requestId) {
    // ... setup code ...
    modal.classList.remove('hidden');
    
    // Load parts and THEN setup handlers
    loadAvailableParts().then(() => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const existingEntries = document.querySelectorAll('.part-entry');
            console.log('Setting up handlers for', existingEntries.length, 'part entries');
            existingEntries.forEach(entry => {
                setupPartEntryHandlers(entry); // Attach handlers to each entry
            });
            updatePartRemoveHandlers();
        }, 100);
    });
}
```

#### 2. Updated `loadAvailableParts()` to return Promise
**File**: `client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
async function loadAvailableParts() {
    // ... fetch code ...
    if (response.ok) {
        availableParts = await response.json();
        updatePartSelectors();
        // No return value
    }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
async function loadAvailableParts() {
    // ... fetch code ...
    if (response.ok) {
        availableParts = await response.json();
        updatePartSelectors();
        return availableParts; // Return for promise chaining
    }
    return []; // Return empty array on error
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Sequence of Events:

1. **User clicks "Complete Service"**
   - `showJobCompletionModal(requestId)` is called

2. **Modal opens immediately**
   - Modal becomes visible
   - Summary is populated

3. **Parts are loaded from API**
   - `loadAvailableParts()` fetches from `/api/technician/parts`
   - Returns array of parts with brand information

4. **Brand selectors are populated**
   - `updatePartSelectors()` â†’ `updateBrandSelectors()`
   - Extracts unique brands
   - Populates all brand dropdowns

5. **Event handlers are attached**
   - After parts load (Promise resolves)
   - `setupPartEntryHandlers()` called for each `.part-entry`
   - Brand change listener: `brandSelect.addEventListener('change', ...)`
   - Part change listener attached
   - Quantity change listener attached

6. **User selects brand (e.g., "HP1")**
   - Brand change event fires
   - `updatePartsForBrand(brandSelector, "HP1")` is called
   - Filters `availableParts` to only HP1 parts
   - Populates part selector with filtered results
   - Part selector becomes enabled

7. **User selects part**
   - Part change event fires
   - Stock info badge appears
   - Quantity input enabled

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```
1. Open modal âœ“
2. Brand dropdown shows brands âœ“
3. Select "HP1" âœ“
4. Part dropdown still says "Select brand first..." âœ— BUG
```

### After Fix:
```
1. Open modal âœ“
2. Brand dropdown shows brands âœ“
3. Select "HP1" âœ“
4. Part dropdown populates with HP1 parts âœ“ FIXED
5. Select a part âœ“
6. Stock info appears âœ“
7. Can enter quantity âœ“
```

## Console Output (Expected)

When modal opens:
```
ðŸ”§ Loading available parts from technician inventory...
Parts API response status: 200
âœ… Loaded parts: [array of 15 parts]
ðŸ”§ Updating part selectors with 15 parts
Found 1 brand selectors
Updating brand selector 1
Setting up handlers for 1 part entries
```

When brand is selected:
```
Brand selected: HP1
ðŸ”§ Updating parts for brand: HP1
âœ… Added 5 parts for brand HP1
```

## Additional Benefits

1. **Consistent State**: Handlers are fresh each time modal opens
2. **Multiple Opens**: Works correctly even after opening/closing multiple times
3. **Form Reset**: Handles form resets properly
4. **Debugging**: Added console logs to track handler setup

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/pages/technician/requests.js`
   - `showJobCompletionModal()` - Added promise-based handler setup
   - `loadAvailableParts()` - Returns promise for chaining

# Coordinator Approval Modal & Notification Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Approval Modal Too Big
**Problem:** The service approval modal in the coordinator page was too large and didn't fit well on the screen.

**Solution:**
- Reduced modal max-width from `max-w-4xl` to `max-w-3xl`
- Changed max-height from `max-h-[90vh]` to `max-h-[85vh]`
- Made the modal content scrollable with proper overflow handling
- Set a fixed height for the scrollable content area: `max-height: calc(85vh - 140px)`
- Compacted all content sections:
  - Reduced padding from `p-4` to `p-3`
  - Changed font sizes from `text-lg` to `text-sm` for headings
  - Changed body text from `text-sm` to `text-xs`
  - Reduced spacing between sections from `space-y-6` to `space-y-4`
  - Combined "Technician Information" and "Resolution Notes" into one section
  - Made button labels more concise ("Reject Service" → "Reject", "Approve Service" → "Approve")

**Files Changed:**
- `client/src/pages/coordinator/service-requests.html` - Modal structure
- `client/src/js/coordinator-service-requests.js` - Modal content rendering

### 2. Duplicate Notifications
**Problem:** When a technician completed a service request, two notifications were being sent:
1. One to the requester saying "Service Completed - Awaiting Approval"
2. One to the coordinator saying "Service Request Pending Your Approval"

This caused duplicate notifications in the notifications page.

**Solution:**
- Removed the notification to the requester when service is submitted for approval
- Now only the coordinator receives a notification when service is pending approval
- The requester will receive a notification AFTER the coordinator approves the service (handled by the approval routes)

**Files Changed:**
- `server/routes/technician-service-requests.js` - Removed requester notification on service completion

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Approval Modal Size
1. Login as a coordinator
2. Go to Service Requests page
3. Find a service request in "Pending Approval" status
4. Click "Review & Approve"
5. Verify:
   - Modal fits nicely on screen
   - Content is scrollable if needed
   - All sections are compact and readable
   - Buttons are properly sized

### Test 2: No Duplicate Notifications
1. Login as a technician
2. Complete a service request (submit for approval)
3. Login as a coordinator
4. Go to Notifications page
5. Verify:
   - Only ONE notification appears for the completed service
   - The notification says "Service Request Pending Your Approval"
   - No duplicate notifications exist

### Test 3: Full Workflow
1. Login as technician, complete a service request
2. Login as coordinator, check notifications (should see 1 notification)
3. Approve the service request
4. Login as requester, check notifications (should see approval notification)
5. Verify no duplicate notifications at any stage

## Additional Notes

- The fix ensures a cleaner, more professional UI for the coordinator approval process
- Notification flow is now more logical: Technician → Coordinator → Requester
- Modal scrolling is smooth and maintains header/footer visibility

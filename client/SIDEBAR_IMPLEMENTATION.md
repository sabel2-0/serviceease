# Sidebar Implementation Improvements

## Changes Made

1. **Updated client-printers.html (admin)**
   - Changed sidebar container from `admin-sidebar` to `sidebar-container`
   - Updated script paths from `/js/` to `../../js/`
   - Replaced admin-sidebar.js with unified-sidebar.js

2. **Updated admin.html**
   - Fixed script paths from `/js/` to `../../js/`

3. **Enhanced unified-sidebar.js**
   - Added support for multiple sidebar container IDs (backward compatibility)
   - Improved error messages with troubleshooting steps
   - Added dynamic path calculation to handle different directory depths

4. **Created documentation**
   - Added README.md in the admin directory with guidelines
   - Created this change log for reference

## Testing

Please test the following scenarios:

1. Open admin.html and verify the sidebar loads correctly
2. Open client-printers.html in the admin section and verify no errors
3. Click different sidebar links to ensure navigation works
4. Log in as operations officer and verify proper role-based content appears

## Future Updates

For all remaining pages, we recommend:

1. Update the sidebar container to `<div id="sidebar-container"></div>`
2. Update script paths to use relative paths (`../../js/`)
3. Replace any role-specific sidebar JS with unified-sidebar.js
4. Test all changes to ensure no console errors

These changes should resolve all the sidebar navigation errors you were experiencing.

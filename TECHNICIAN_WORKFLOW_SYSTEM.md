# ServiceEase Technician Workflow System 🧩

## Overview

This enhanced technician system implements a comprehensive workflow for service request management, allowing technicians like Alex to efficiently handle service requests from assignment to completion with proper job order documentation.

## Real-World Workflow Example

### Scenario: Alex the Technician

Alex logs into ServiceEase and navigates to the Service Requests page where he sees:

1. **Request #2025-0001** – "HP LaserJet not printing black ink properly" (Pajo Elementary School)
2. **Request #2025-0002** – "Canon printer paper jam error" (Library)
3. **Request #2025-0003** – "Brother printer completely stopped working" (Cordova High School)

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Starting a Service
- Alex clicks on Request #2025-0001
- Views detailed information: client, location, equipment details, issue description
- Clicks **"Start Service"** button
- System automatically:
  - Updates status to "In Progress"
  - Records `started_at` timestamp
  - Confirms Alex as assigned technician

#### 2. Completing a Service
- After diagnosing and fixing the issue, Alex clicks **"Complete Service"**
- A comprehensive Job Order Form opens with:

##### Service Actions (Required)
```
Diagnosed toner cartridge issue. Found HP Toner Cartridge 85A was low and causing streaky prints.

```

##### Parts Used

- **Quantity**: 1
- *(Can add multiple parts with + button)*

##### Additional Notes
```
Recommended to client:
- Monitor toner levels monthly
- Use high-quality paper to prevent print head issues
- Schedule quarterly cleaning maintenance
```

##### Client Acknowledgment

#### 3. System Processing
When Alex submits the completion:

- Records `completed_at` timestamp
- Creates Job Order record with all details
- Updates inventory (reduces HP Toner Cartridge stock by 1)
- Generates service history log
- Stores client signature for record-keeping
